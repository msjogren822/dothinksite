This is mostly just a sandbox site. I have made sandbox sites since the 90s but the functionality has changed over the years for making them. It started out as just a flat HTML/CSS site that had a link to a WordPress site. Almost everything is free hosting. Recently, though, I have been working with Github more and its connection to SaaS AI analysis, deployment and database providers.

The main landing page is here. It's kind of a general "me" page.
