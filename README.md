This is mostly just a sandbox site. I have made sandbox sites since the 90s but the functionality has changed over the years for making them. It started out as just a flat HTML/CSS site that had a link to a WordPress site. Almost everything is free hosting. Recently, though, I have been working with Github more and its connection to deployment and database SaaS providers, as well as AI analysis of my experiments and plans.
